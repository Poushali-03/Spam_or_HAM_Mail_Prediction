# Spam_or_HAM_Mail_Prediction using Machine Learning


This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict whether an email is spam or not spam (ham). The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled email data, where each email is classified as either spam or ham.

# Why do we need this?
Spam emails are a prevalent issue in today's digital communication landscape. They can be a nuisance, wasting time and resources, and in some cases, they can also be malicious, leading to phishing attacks or spreading malware. By accurately predicting and filtering out spam emails, we can improve email communication efficiency, security, and user experience.

# Getting Started
